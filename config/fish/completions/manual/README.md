You can copy/create a symlink here for any `.fish` completion file for any program

> [!WARNING]
> It seems that the file name is strict, it should be `<program_name>.fish` (for instance `<program_name>.completion.fish` will not work)

For instance: `ln -s /mnt/data/pbin/dysk/current/build/completion/dysk.fish dysk.fish`
